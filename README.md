# Sandpile Cellular Automata

Sandpile Cellular Automata using the C programming language and the raylib library for visualization. The sandpile model is a type of cellular automaton that exhibits self-organized criticality, a property where a system naturally evolves into a critical state where a minor event can lead to significant consequences.
